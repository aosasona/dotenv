# dotenv

Dotenv is a port of the popular Javascript [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/master/lib/main.js) packages that helps you load environment variables from .env (or other) files.
This package supports both Erlang and Javascript (Node, Deno) targets thanks to the fact that it uses the awesome [Simplifile](https://github.com/bcpeinhardt/simplifile) package under the hood.
